Nice, your load balancer is already in great shape ✅ (strategies, health checks, chaos injection, Prometheus metrics). If you want to push it further — here are **next-level features** that are realistic and resume-worthy:

---

# 🚀 Features You Can Add to Your Load Balancer

### 1. **Weighted Round Robin (done partially)**

* Already started — refine it so traffic is distributed *proportionally* by weights.
* Add ability to change weights dynamically (from config reload).

---

### 2. **Circuit Breaker** 🛑

* If a backend keeps failing health checks (e.g. 5 consecutive fails), mark it **DOWN** for X seconds before retrying.
* Protects your system from sending requests to “flapping” or dead servers.

---

### 3. **Retries with Backoff** 🔁

* If a backend returns 5xx, retry request on another healthy backend.
* Add exponential backoff (e.g., wait 100ms → 200ms → 400ms before retry).

---

### 4. **Request Timeout + Deadlines** ⏱️

* Add per-request deadlines (e.g., drop request if backend doesn’t respond in 2s).
* This avoids clients being stuck forever.

---

### 5. **Rate Limiting** 🚦

* Prevent overload by limiting requests per second (per client IP or globally).
* Can implement with a **token bucket** or **leaky bucket** algorithm.

---

### 6. **Sticky Sessions** 🍪

* Option to send the same client (by cookie or IP hash) to the same backend.
* Useful for apps that don’t share session state.

---

### 7. **TLS Termination** 🔒

* Accept HTTPS on the proxy → forward plain HTTP to backends.
* Add automatic certificate management (e.g. Let’s Encrypt).

---

### 8. **Admin Dashboard / API** 📊

* Expose `/status` endpoint → show:

  * healthy/unhealthy backends
  * active connections
  * error counts
* Or build a small **HTML/JSON dashboard** with Go templates.

---

### 9. **Graceful Shutdown** ✅

* On `SIGTERM`, stop accepting new requests but finish ongoing ones.
* Prevents dropped requests during deploys.

---

### 10. **Service Discovery** 🔍

* Instead of static YAML, support DNS or Consul/Etcd/ZooKeeper for discovering backends dynamically.

---

⚡ Each of these adds “real-world” flavor — many are exactly what **NGINX, Envoy, HAProxy** do.
You don’t need all at once; even **2–3 more features** make it very impressive on a resume.

👉 Do you want me to pick **one concrete next feature (like circuit breaker)** and show you exactly how to add it step by step to your code?

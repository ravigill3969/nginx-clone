Nice — let’s jump back to your proxy server project 🚀

Right now, you’ve already built a pretty capable reverse proxy in Go with:

* **Round Robin, Random, Least Connections, Weighted** strategies
* **Health checks** with goroutines
* **/metrics endpoint** for Prometheus
* **Config reload with fsnotify**
* **Chaos injection (error rate)**
* **Timeouts with context**
* **Sticky sessions (cookie/IP)**

That’s already **resume-worthy** for small-scale distributed systems work.

# 🔹 Next Topics We Could Add to the Proxy

### 1. **Circuit Breaker** 🛑

* If a backend fails N times in a row → mark as DOWN for X seconds.
* Prevents constant retries to a dead backend.
* Works with your health checker but adds stateful fail tracking.

---

### 2. **Retries** 🔁

* If a backend fails for a request → try another healthy backend (up to 3 times).
* Controlled via YAML config (`max_retries: 2`).
* Needs to integrate with context deadlines.

---

### 3. **Rate Limiting** 🚦

* Per-client or per-backend request limits.
* Can use a token bucket or leaky bucket algorithm.
* Example YAML:

  ```yaml
  rate_limit_per_client: 100 # requests per minute
  ```

---

### 4. **Graceful Shutdown** 🛑

* Stop accepting new requests but finish ongoing ones.
* Useful in Kubernetes when a pod is being killed.

---

### 5. **Dynamic Backends** ⚡

* Allow `/admin/add-backend` or `/admin/remove-backend` endpoints.
* Lets you scale backends in/out at runtime without YAML reload.

---

### 6. **Observability Additions** 📊

* Histograms for request latency (`proxy_request_duration_seconds`).
* Error counters (`proxy_errors_total`).
* Separate metrics per backend.

---

# 🔹 Big Picture

Once you add **circuit breakers + retries**, your proxy will handle failures gracefully.
Once you add **rate limiting**, it protects backends.
Once you add **graceful shutdown**, it’s Kubernetes-ready.

👉 Do you want to start with **circuit breaker**, since it’s the most natural next step after health checks?
